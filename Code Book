About the original data set
------------------
I got the data set from [UCI Machine Learning repository]. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 

How I modify the data
------------------
As requested by the course project, I manipulate the original data set in the following steps:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

About the tidy data set I created
------------------
### Units
Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

### Descriptive Column/Variable Names

>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and >tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then >they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 >Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration >signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 >Hz. 
>
>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals >(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated >using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
>
>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk>-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain >signals). "


Based to my own understanding of above text in the *feature_info.txt* provided with the dataset, I labeled the variables with the following rules:


### More Columns
The first few columns indicate the Subject, Activity and Data type of the tidy data set are the activity and the subject of this observation.
